;; Add company support to Amber Emacs.

;;; Code:

(use-package company
  :hook

  (company-tooltip-align-annotations t)
  (company-require-match 'never)
  ;; Only search the current buffer for `company-dabbrev' (a backend that
  ;; suggests text your open buffers). This prevents Company from causing
  ;; lag once you have a lot of buffers open.
  (company-dabbrev-other-buffers nil)
  ;; Make `company-dabbrev' fully case-sensitive, to improve UX with
  ;; domain-specific words with particular casing.
  (company-dabbrev-ignore-case nil)
  (company-dabbrev-downcase nil)
