** Hosts
*** Gaia
Personal programming machine. Used for experimentation with Guix.
Will be the base of my next Guix machines.

- reference :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia

Gaia is the mother of Titans, she is the base of the other systems, the one who have done the foundation.

*** Kratos (dead, but will be revived)
My server, used to build packages from my channels (and others, probably).

- reference :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kratos_(mythology)

Spirit of strenght. This server is a beefy machine, born from Gaia, has the most strenght.


*** Geras
Working machine. Currently on NixOS but I use Guix to setup my home with it.
Since I may have to switch to a non-declarative distribution, Guix will be my main service.

- reference :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geras

Spirit of old age. Since I want to switch to Guix, NixOS is my old system.
